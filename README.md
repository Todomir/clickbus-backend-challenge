# Clickbus Backend Challenge

A simple REST API using Express, Knex and Typescript.

### Initial configuration

First, you'll need to install the dependencies using your preferred package manager.
You can run either `yarn` or `npm install`.
Then, you'll need to run the migration script with `yarn knex:migrate` or `npm run knex:migrate`.

After that you're free to test every endpoint.
